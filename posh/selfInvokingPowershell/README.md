# DISCLAIMER:

Since english is not my primary language, I'm not really sure if the name of the script in this folder describes it properly.
Not too confident about my vocabulary here.

You might also wanna describe the script as:

"A batch file that invokes powershell commands from inside itself."

or:

"A powershell script inside of a batch file that is invoked by some preceding lines of batch commands."

I found it on stackoverflow:

If you want to school me on my grammar or my use of words here, please don't hesitate to open an issue.

Thank you
